/*
It should be noted that this program is intended to run on the Arduino Uno R4 Minima, not the Wi-Fi
a typical input/output response system will be achieved through this program. the prototype,
with the use of a pump, sensor, and LED, will begin function when analog values exceed the
stated threshold through the sensor displaying conductivity units onto the serial monitor.
once conductivity has been recorded to be less than or quivalate to that of the given threshold,
the pump will stop its fucntion, and the LED will turn on, indicating that the system has stopped.
this indicates that the procedure being simulated has been completed successfully.
