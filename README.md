This is a response based prototype system that relies solely on conductivity values picked up by a simple sensor made by pure aluminum foil. Inspired by the rising problem and concern regarding calcification that occurs in aortic stenosis (valvular diseases, refer to the US Medical Library), this model acts as a blood incision based transfusion system, where a calcium mock (distilled water) will be sucked and exported out from the aortic valve (pump on ~11), and deposited into a separate compartment. After, blood mock (tap water) will be pumped back into the valve (pump on ~10) in order to stimulate the tissue within the valve once more i.e. stiff tissue prior to the procedure. This is purely a simulation as to what could be considered a self-proclaimed medical procedure that can be considered in the future if the success of the project is deemed as triumphant.

Note: Distilled water has conductivity greater than 0, but less than 1023
Note: Tap water has exactly 1023 conductivity, or fluctuates 2-3 units below the standard
Note: Serial monitor to be used for monitoring conductivity flow and accuracy.
